  "body": "### Welcome to Shadey Security's Simple Asset Inventory System\r\nThis system of scripts is designed to make it super easy for your personal or enterprise inventorying needs!\r\nContinue to checkback and provide issues with ideas, we listen as long as we have time!\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThe need for this tool was initially internally, and very brittle. We decided to migrate it to open source predominantly for two reasons:\r\n* Github is free, we like free more than we do open-source, which we love\r\n* It allows people outside of the small scripting duo it was originally in to work on it\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nWant to contribute? Please contact @theshades to be added once vetted, or simple do a pull request!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@theshades - Most of the front-end work, some of the backend work, original idea holder\r\n@JKauff - A large portion of the backend work\r\n@wasupmang - Nessus integration\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with our Simple Asset Inventory System? Validate our build/compile status in the README as well as check our issues. If we dont have an issue for your issue / bug open, feel free to open an issue even if we know things won't build. This keeps us on our toes! ;)",
